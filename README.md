# testimonial-cards

A simple static testimonial cards component / website — based on the roadmap.sh **Testimonial Cards** project.  
https://roadmap.sh/projects/testimonial-cards

## 🌟 Project Overview

This repository contains a testimonial-cards component / static page, designed to showcase user/testimonial cards. The goal is to build a clean, accessible, and easy-to-read testimonial section using only HTML (and optionally CSS), following the “Testimonial Cards” project guidelines.

The component can be used standalone or as part of a larger site — ideal for portfolios, company pages, or projects where you want a testimonial section.

## 🚀 Getting Started / Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ryan-carrot/testimonial-cards.git
2. Open index.html (or your main HTML file) in your browser to view the testimonial cards locally.
3. Customize the testimonial cards:
4. Replace placeholder photos, names, and testimonials with real content.
5. Optionally add your own CSS / styling.
6. (Optional) Deploy the component/site using GitHub Pages (or another static host) for public access.

## 📄 Live Demo

This project can be deployed via GitHub Pages (or another static-site host) for public viewing.

## 🧩 What This Project Gives You

## 📂 Project Structure (typical)
```bash
testimonial-cards/
│
├── index.html         # Main HTML page showing testimonial cards
├── README.md          # This documentation
└── assets/            # (optional) Images, CSS, JS, etc.
    ├── css/
    ├── js/
    └── images/
```
(Actual file structure may vary depending on how many cards or assets you include.)

## ✅ Notes & Considerations

- The content currently may use placeholder / mock data (names, testimonials, photos). You should replace them with real data when deploying.
- The component is static — no JavaScript or dynamic backend by default.
- Styling is minimal or optional — feel free to add your own CSS for layout, responsiveness, and design polish.

## 🎯 Possible Future Enhancements

- Add CSS styling for layout, typography, spacing, and responsive design (In Progress)
- Add more testimonial cards and organize them (e.g. grid, carousel, or list)
- Add avatar photos / profile images for each testimonial
- Add smooth transitions or hover effects (if you opt-in to use CSS or minimal JS)
- Integrate the testimonial component into a larger website or project

Feel free to fork or adapt this template to use in your own projects — or extend it as needed for your needs. 👍
